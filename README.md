install.packages("devtools")

```

### **Install FlexiPredict R from GitHub:**

```
devtools::install_github("yourusername/FlexiPredictR")
```

### **Usage:**

```
After installation, load the package in your R session:

library(FlexiPredictR)
```

### **Files and Descriptions:**

#### **Elastic.R**
This file implements elastic net regression for both binary and continuous response variables. It combines the properties of both ridge and lasso regression to provide robust regularization.

#### **Ensemble.R**
This file handles ensemble learning, allowing users to fit multiple models on the same dataset and combine the results. This enhances the prediction accuracy and robustness.

#### **RandomForest.R**
This file includes the implementation of the random forest algorithm. It is used for both classification and regression tasks and provides an effective way to handle large datasets with high dimensionality.

#### **Lasso.R**
This file implements lasso regression, which performs both variable selection and regularization to enhance the prediction accuracy and interpretability of the statistical model it produces.

#### **LinearReg.R**
This file includes the implementation of linear regression for continuous response variables. It is one of the fundamental tools for predictive modeling and statistical analysis.

#### **Ridge.R**
This file implements ridge regression, which is useful for analyzing multiple regression data that suffer from multicollinearity. By imposing a penalty on the size of coefficients, it helps to reduce overfitting.

#### **LogisticReg.R**
This file includes the implementation of logistic regression for binary response variables. It is widely used for classification problems in various fields.

#### **PreScreenPredictors.R**
This file handles the pre-screening of predictors, particularly useful when the number of predictors is much larger than the number of observations. It selects the top K most informative predictors for model fitting.

#### **Features**

Multiple Regression Models: Linear, logistic, ridge, lasso, and elastic net.
Machine Learning Algorithms: Support vector machine, random forest, and boosted trees.
Feature Selection: Pre-screening of predictors for high-dimensional data.
Bagging: Robust model fitting through bagging for various regression models.
Ensemble Learning: Combining multiple models for improved prediction accuracy.





#### Example usage of the linear regression function
```
data <- data.frame(y = rnorm(100), x1 = rnorm(100), x2 = rnorm(100))
fit <- linear_regression(y ~ x1 + x2, data)
summary(fit)

# Example usage of the ensemble function
ensemble_fit <- ensemble(y ~ x1 + x2, data, models = c("linear", "randomForest"))
summary(ensemble_fit)
```
